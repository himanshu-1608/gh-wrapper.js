# gh-wrapper.js

This will be an npm module which acts as a wrapper between GitHub's Octocat REST API and an end-user.

Will work in the same way as express.js works- ***Less Technicality, Better Output***

Originally, this wrapper is being developed for the sole purpose of creating resume through accessing the projects and other basic details of a user.

However, I may extend it, if nature says so.
